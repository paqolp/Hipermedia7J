            <a href="http://www.google.com" style="text-decoration: none;">ACM Updates Code of Ethics</a>
            <p>ACM has updated its
                <a href="https://www.google.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>. The revised Code of Ethics addresses the significant advances
                in computing technology since the 1992 version, as well as the growing pervasiveness of computing in all
                aspects of society. ACM’s Code of Ethics is considered the standard for the computing profession, and has
                been adopted by computing professionals, organizations and technology companies around the world. The Code
                is a collection of principles and guidelines designed to help computing professionals make ethically responsible
                decisions in professional practice.</p>

                        ACM has named Vicki L. Hanson to the position of executive director and CEO effective July 1, 2018. As ACM’s most senior
                        staff member, Hanson will work with ACM’s volunteer community to provide strategic vision and to
                        develop sustainable business models to ensure ACM’s continued worldwide membership, publications
                        and revenue growth. ACM President-elect Cherri Pancake said, “Having served ACM for many years in
                        various volunteer capacities, Vicki’s unique insights into the organization and how it serves the
                        profession should serve us well to ensure a sustainable future for ACM."

                <p>
                    Online social networks are not only huge in scale, they are predicted to keep growing in the coming years both in the number
                    of users and in the amount of data users upload and share. There have been many efforts devoted to study
                    privacy in social media and how to protect users' personal information since the very early days of social
                    media. However, most of these efforts have focused on privacy from an individual point of view. Privacy
                    is not just about what you say or disclose about yourself. It is also about what others say or disclose
                    about you. In this video, Jose M. Such discusses "Multiparty Privacy in Social Media,” a Review Article
                    in the August 2018 issue of Communications of the ACM.

                <p>
                    ACM Queue’s “Research for Practice” is your number one resource for keeping up with emerging developments in the world of
                    theory and applying them to the challenges you face on a daily basis. In this installment, Dan Crankshaw
                    and Joey Gonzalez provide an overview of machine learning server systems. What happens when we wish to
                    actually deploy a machine learning model to production, and how do we serve predictions with high accuracy
                    and high computational efficiency? Dan and Joey’s curated research selection presents cutting-edge techniques
                    spanning database-level integration, video processing, and prediction middleware. Given the explosion
                    of interest in machine learning and its increasing impact on seemingly every application vertical, it's
                    possible that systems such as these will become as commonplace as relational databases are today.

            community, expresses concern over US President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order imposing suspension of visas
            to nationals of six countries. The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central

            and responsible practice of science is fundamental to scientific advancement and human and environmental well-being.
            Such practice, in all its aspects, requires freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for
