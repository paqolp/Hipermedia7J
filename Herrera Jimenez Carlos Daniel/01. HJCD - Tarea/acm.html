                    <h3><a href="#">ACM Updates Code of Ethics</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        ACM has updated its <a href="#">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>. The revised Code of Ethics addresses <br>
                        the significant advances in computing technology since the 1992 version, as well as the growing <br>
                         pervasiveness of computing in all aspects of society. ACM’s Code of Ethics is considered the standard <br>
                         for the computing profession, and has been adopted by computing professionals, organizations and <br>
                         technology companies around the world. The Code is a collection of principles and guidelines designed <br>
                         to help computing professionals make ethically responsible decisions in professional practice.

                    <h3><a href="#">CACM August 2018 - Multiparty Privacy in Social Media</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        Online social networks are not only huge in scale, they are predicted to keep growing in the coming <br>
                        years both in the number of users and in the amount of data users upload and share. There have <br>
                        been many efforts devoted to study privacy in social media and how to protect users' personal <br>
                        information since the very early days of social media. However, most of these efforts have focused <br>
                        on privacy from an individual point of view. Privacy is not just about what you say or disclose about <br>
                        yourself. It is also about what others say or disclose about you. In this video, Jose M. Such discusses <br>
                        "Multiparty Privacy in Social Media,” a Review Article in the August 2018 issue of Communications of <br>
                        the ACM.

                    <p>
                        ACM Queue’s “Research for Practice” is your <br>
                        number one resource for keeping up with <br>
                        emerging developments in the world of <br>
                        theory and applying them to the challenges <br>
                        you face on a daily basis. In this installment, <br>
                        Dan Crankshaw and Joey Gonzalez provide an overview <br>
                        of machine learning server systems. <br>
                        What happens when we wish to actually <br>
                        deploy a machine learning model to <br>
                        production, and how do we serve predictions <br>
                        with high accuracy and high computational <br>
                        efficiency? Dan and Joey’s curated research <br>
                        selection presents cutting-edge techniques <br>
                        spanning database-level integration, video <br>
                        processing, and prediction middleware. Given <br>
                        the explosion of interest in machine learning <br>
                        and its increasing impact on seemingly every <br>
                        application vertical, it's possible that systems <br>
                        such as these will become as commonplace as <br>
                        relational databases are today.
